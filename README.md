# choice

#Choice is a game inspired by the Persephone and Hades myth from Greek mythology. 

#This choose-your-own-adventure game puts you in the shoes of Persephone as she gets sucked into the Underworld and meets Hades. 

#Will she be able to escape, or does she even want to?



#The game plays with the idea of choice in the way that there is none. 

#No matter the choices made in the game, Persephone faces the same fate: marrying Hades. 

#The only difference is if she willingly made that choice and is unaware of the alternative or if she is forced into that life.
